**Overview**: During the Level 3 Data Technician Bootcamp, I improved my skills and understanding of analysing data to the basic level and also writing python codes with the usage of pandas in order to extract, retrieve and present information from a database. It was quite the learning curve and I have yet to develop and make use of being proficient in it however I have completed some tasks to the basic level here using Python Pandas to analyse datasets. In the attached links and the images below you will see examples of my applied work in relation to working with data and the files attached to this task, but as I cannot for some reason share the original files I will put screenshots of the examples of the responses I wrote to the questions in the practice sheets that I used to answer data related questions.

The dataset in question was regarding the economical data based on quantity, unit price as well as other datasets. Using Pandas we can prompt the code to return back certain pieces of data that would be useful for analysis as I done in this exercise.
